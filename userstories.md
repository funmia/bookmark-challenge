The task is to make a bookmark manager which is a website to maintain a collection of URLS, with the following user stories:

```
As a user
So that I can go to websites I visit regularly
I would like to see a list of links on the homepage

As a user
So that I can quickly find links I recently bookmarked
I would like to see links in descending chronological order

As a user
So that I can save a website
I would like to be able to add the site's address and link to my bookmark manager

As a user
So that I can organise my many links into different categories for ease of search
I would like to able to add tags to the links in my bookmark manager

As a user
So that I can quickly find links on a particular topic
I would like to able to filter links by tag

```
